# macOS VM Networking Options — Design Analysis

*Researched 2026-03-11. Updated 2026-03-20 to reflect smoltcp NAT relay (PR #117,
v0.2.0). Covers pelagos-mac context: pure-Rust AVF stack, `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
developer tool targeting macOS 13.5+.*

---

## Background

pelagos-mac boots Linux VMs via Apple's `Virtualization.framework` (AVF). Every
networking option available to an AVF-based VM ultimately flows through one of the
mechanisms below. This document evaluates each on six axes plus additional
project-specific factors.

**Current implementation (v0.2.0):** `VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment` paired
with a pure-Rust smoltcp userspace NAT relay (`pelagos-vz/src/nat_relay.rs`). See
option 5 + option 6 in the tables, and the "Implemented Solution" section at the
bottom.

---

## The Options

### 1. `VZNATNetworkDeviceAttachment` ← replaced in v0.2.0

**What it is:** AVF's "no-entitlement NAT" attachment. One method call; AVF creates
a virtual NIC and the host provides NAT, DHCP, and DNS via the
`InternetSharing`/`NetworkSharing` daemon, which installs masquerade rules into the
kernel's PF packet filter.

**How it works under the hood:**
```
VM virtio-net NIC
  → AVF network device layer
    → InternetSharing / NetworkSharing daemon
      → PF kernel packet filter (NAT anchor)
        → host default route → internet
```
The DHCP server and DNS forwarder are also in the daemon layer. After N VM
lifecycles, `InternetSharing` loses its connection to the PF kernel device
(`connection error: Connection invalid`), the anchor is never installed on the next
VM start, and outbound TCP silently dies. ICMP may continue to work through a
stale or default PF rule.

On **macOS 26**, the daemon was renamed `com.apple.NetworkSharing` and is now
SIP-protected — the user-land kickstart workaround that worked on macOS 13–15 is
no longer available.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | Moderate. Kernel NAT path when healthy; overhead from daemon mediation. |
| **Reliability** | **Poor.** Degrades after ~5 VM boots in a session; requires reboot on macOS 26 to recover. |
| **Security** | Good. NAT provides strong VM isolation by default; no additional attack surface. |
| **Long-term viability** | **Concerning.** InternetSharing has been progressively locked down (SIP on Tahoe). Apple's direction is `vmnet.framework`; NAT attachment may become more restricted. |
| **Entitlements** | None required. ✓ |
| **Open source** | No. Proprietary Apple implementation. |
| **Implementation complexity** | Trivial (one-liner in `pelagos-vz`). |
| **Host → VM connectivity** | No (NAT-only; no inbound unless port forwarding is added). |
| **Multi-VM** | Works; each VM gets its own 192.168.64.x address. |
| **Distribution impact** | None. No extra setup needed. |

---

### 2. `vmnet.framework` direct (`com.apple.vm.networking` entitlement)

**What it is:** Apple's dedicated VM networking framework, introduced in macOS 10.10.
Provides three modes: `VMNET_SHARED_MODE` (NAT), `VMNET_HOST_MODE` (host-only),
`VMNET_BRIDGED_MODE`. Bypasses `InternetSharing` entirely — the NAT is implemented
directly in the kernel via `vmnet`, not via PF anchors.

**How it works:**
```
VM virtio-net NIC (via VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment)
  → vmnet.framework (kernel driver)
    → [shared mode] kernel NAT → host default route → internet
    → [host mode]   192.168.x.0/24 isolated network, no internet
    → [bridged mode] passthrough to physical NIC, VM appears on LAN
```

The key difference from option 1: `vmnet` does not use PF anchors. It has its own
kernel-level NAT implementation that does not degrade across VM lifecycles.

**The entitlement problem:** `com.apple.vm.networking` is a **private entitlement**
restricted to licensed virtualization vendors (OrbStack, Docker Desktop, Parallels,
VMware). There is no self-service approval path. Getting it requires an Apple
Developer Relations contract — effectively, proving you are shipping a commercial
virtualization product.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | **Excellent.** Kernel-level vmnet driver; no daemon mediation. Low latency, high throughput. |
| **Reliability** | **Excellent.** No PF anchor degradation. vmnet interface is stable across VM lifecycles. |
| **Security** | Excellent. Kernel isolation; modes are cleanly separated. Bridged mode exposes VM to LAN — use shared or host mode for developer tooling. |
| **Long-term viability** | **Excellent.** This is Apple's strategic VM networking API. OrbStack and Docker Desktop depend on it. Apple has strong incentive to maintain it. |
| **Entitlements** | **Private entitlement — requires Apple contract.** Blocker for most independent developers. |
| **Open source** | No. Proprietary Apple framework. |
| **Implementation complexity** | Moderate. Must use `VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment` to bridge vmnet ↔ AVF; requires a C shim or Rust `vmnet-sys` binding. |
| **Host → VM connectivity** | Yes (with vmnet shared/host mode — the host interface is reachable). |
| **Multi-VM** | Yes; vmnet handles multiple interfaces. |
| **Distribution impact** | Requires Apple entitlement approval before shipping. |

---

### 3. `socket_vmnet` (privileged helper wrapping `vmnet.framework`) ← evaluated, replaced

**What it is:** An Apache 2.0 privileged helper daemon, maintained by the Lima team
(`github.com/lima-vm/socket_vmnet`), that runs as root via launchd and exposes
`vmnet.framework` networking to unprivileged processes via a Unix socket with fd
passing. Used by Lima (v0.12+) and QEMU on macOS.

**How it works:**
```
VM virtio-net NIC (via VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment)
  → socket_vmnet_client (unprivileged, fd passed via Unix socket)
    → /var/run/socket_vmnet (Unix socket)
      → socket_vmnet daemon (runs as root, holds vmnet handle)
        → vmnet.framework (kernel driver, shared/host/bridged)
```

The insight: running as root is sufficient to call `vmnet.framework` — the
`com.apple.vm.networking` entitlement is only required when calling vmnet from
a sandboxed or signed-but-unprivileged process. A root daemon sidesteps the
entitlement entirely.

**Installation:** A launchd plist at `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` installs the daemon.
The binary lives at `/opt/socket_vmnet/bin/socket_vmnet` (root-only writable path
for security). Homebrew can install it: `brew install socket_vmnet`.

**Modes supported:** `shared` (internet-accessible NAT, default, gateway
`192.168.105.1`), `host` (isolated, VM-to-host only), `bridged`.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | **Good.** vmnet kernel path for actual packet forwarding; minor IPC overhead for fd passing at setup time (~negligible after connect). |
| **Reliability** | **Excellent.** Inherits vmnet's stability. No PF anchor degradation. Single daemon persists across all VM lifecycles. |
| **Security** | Good with caveats. The helper runs as root — it is a privileged daemon on the host. Socket permissions (mode 0600, owner root) restrict who can connect. Needs careful installation to `/opt/socket_vmnet` (not `/usr/local`, which is user-writable). |
| **Long-term viability** | **Good.** Actively maintained (Lima org, CNCF Incubating). Tracks vmnet.framework changes. Risk: if Apple restricts vmnet from root processes, this breaks; currently Apple has no such restriction. |
| **Entitlements** | **None required on caller binary.** The helper daemon handles the privileged call. ✓ |
| **Open source** | **Yes. Apache 2.0.** ✓ |
| **Implementation complexity** | Moderate. Need to: (a) bundle/install socket_vmnet as a launchd daemon, (b) use `VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment` to bridge vmnet fds into AVF, (c) implement fd passing from socket_vmnet_client. Adds a system-level installation step. |
| **Host → VM connectivity** | Yes (vmnet shared/host mode). |
| **Multi-VM** | Yes; multiple VMs share one daemon; unique MAC addresses required. |
| **Distribution impact** | **Adds an installer step.** A signed `.pkg` installer can install the launchd daemon and set ownership to root. Needs a privileged install (standard for `.pkg`). |

---

### 4. `VZBridgedNetworkDeviceAttachment`

**What it is:** AVF attachment that bridges the VM's virtual NIC directly to a
physical host network interface. The VM appears as a peer on the LAN with its own
DHCP-assigned or static IP.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | **Excellent.** Kernel bridge, minimal overhead over bare metal. |
| **Reliability** | Good. No daemon-mediated NAT; depends on physical network health. |
| **Security** | **Poor for developer tooling.** VM is fully visible on the LAN. No isolation between VM traffic and host network. Containers could initiate connections to other LAN machines. |
| **Long-term viability** | Tied to `com.apple.vm.networking` entitlement path (same as option 2). |
| **Entitlements** | **`com.apple.vm.networking` required.** Same private entitlement blocker. |
| **Open source** | No. |
| **Implementation complexity** | Low once entitlement is obtained. |
| **Host → VM connectivity** | Yes — VM is a full LAN peer. |
| **Multi-VM** | Yes; each VM needs a unique MAC. |
| **Use case fit** | Poor. Bridging is designed for server VMs that need a real LAN presence, not developer container workloads where isolation is desirable. |

---

### 5. `VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment` (raw Ethernet frames) ← used in current implementation

**What it is:** AVF attachment that exposes the VM's virtual NIC as a pair of file
handles for raw Ethernet frame I/O. You provide a connected datagram socket (`SOCK_DGRAM`)
and AVF sends/receives raw layer-2 frames through it. You are responsible for
everything above the wire: routing, NAT, DHCP, DNS.

This is not a standalone networking option — it is the **plumbing layer** used to
connect AVF to any real networking backend:
- Pair with `vmnet.framework` (via socket_vmnet or direct) → options 2/3
- Pair with a TUN device + host routing → option 6
- Pair with a user-space TCP/IP stack → option 7 (SLIRP variant)

MTU: default 1500 bytes; configurable up to 65535 on macOS 13+ via
`setMaximumTransmissionUnit`.
Socket buffer recommendation: `SO_RCVBUF` ≥ 4× `SO_SNDBUF`.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | Depends entirely on what's on the other end of the socket. |
| **Reliability** | The attachment itself is reliable; reliability depends on the backend. |
| **Security** | Neutral — you implement the security model. |
| **Entitlements** | **None.** The attachment type itself requires no entitlement. ✓ |
| **Open source** | N/A (AVF mechanism, not a standalone solution). |
| **Implementation complexity** | **High.** You must implement or integrate a full networking backend. |
| **Role in pelagos** | This is the integration point used in v0.2.0 — paired with the smoltcp NAT relay. |

---

### 6. SLIRP / `libslirp` (user-mode networking)

**What it is:** A user-space TCP/IP stack originally written for SLIP emulation,
now maintained as `libslirp` (LGPL 2.1) by the QEMU community. QEMU uses it as its
default `user` networking mode. No kernel involvement — every packet is processed by
the library inside the calling process.

**How it works:**
```
VM virtio-net NIC
  → raw Ethernet frames
    → libslirp (user-space TCP/IP: ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP implemented in library)
      → host TCP/UDP socket calls → internet
```
The library intercepts each frame, unwraps the TCP/UDP payload, makes real system
calls from the host side, then synthesizes response frames. It is complete NAT in
software.

**Performance:** QEMU's own documentation characterizes user-mode networking as
having "a lot of overhead so the performance is poor." Benchmarks consistently show
30–50% throughput reduction vs kernel NAT for bulk transfers. Latency adds 0.5–2ms
per round-trip from the user-space processing loop. For container image pulls
(bulk HTTPS transfers), this is measurable.

**Note on Rust (updated v0.2.0):** pelagos-mac implemented the smoltcp-based userspace
NAT relay (PR #117). `smoltcp` is a Rust no-std TCP/IP stack; we added the host-side
socket proxying that makes it work as NAT. UDP is handled entirely outside smoltcp
(raw frame interception + reply synthesis); TCP uses smoltcp with a default IPv4 route.
This is architecturally similar to SLIRP but pure Rust, no LGPL, and no C dependency.
Performance is sufficient for OCI image pulls and devcontainer builds — 27/27 e2e tests
pass.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | **Poor.** 30–50% throughput overhead vs kernel NAT. Higher latency. |
| **Reliability** | **Excellent.** Pure user-space, no kernel state. Cannot degrade. |
| **Security** | **Excellent isolation.** No host network involvement; zero OS-level attack surface from the VM side. |
| **Long-term viability** | **Excellent.** No OS dependency whatsoever. Works identically on every macOS version. |
| **Entitlements** | **None.** ✓ |
| **Open source** | LGPL 2.1 (libslirp). LGPL imposes linking obligations in proprietary distributions. |
| **Implementation complexity** | Moderate-high. C FFI binding + license management. Or build on smoltcp + custom host-side socket proxying (~significant engineering). |
| **Host → VM connectivity** | No by default (same limitation as NAT). Port forwarding must be implemented explicitly. |
| **Multi-VM** | Yes; each SLIRP instance is independent. |
| **Use case fit** | Acceptable for low-frequency operations; problematic for container image pulls at scale. QEMU uses it only because it requires no setup. |

---

### 7. Kernel Extensions (kexts) — Parallels / VMware legacy model

**What it is:** Both Parallels and VMware historically installed kernel extensions
to create their own virtual network interfaces (e.g. `vmnet1`, `vmnet8` on Linux;
`feth0`, `bridge100` variants on macOS). This gave them deep OS integration and
very high performance.

**Status:** Apple has been deprecating kexts since macOS 10.15 Catalina. macOS 12
Monterey made loading third-party kexts require explicit user approval. Both Parallels
(v18+) and VMware (Fusion 13+) have transitioned their networking layer to
System Extensions (`NetworkExtension` framework + `NEDriverKit`). New kext-based
networking is **not viable for new development**.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | Was excellent; irrelevant for new code. |
| **Long-term viability** | **Dead.** Kext loading is increasingly restricted and will be removed. |
| **Entitlements** | Requires kext signing certificate from Apple (separate from Developer ID). |
| **Open source** | No. |
| **Verdict** | Not a viable option. Document for completeness only. |

---

### 8. Apple `Containerization` framework (macOS 26+)

**What it is:** Apple's open-source (Apache 2.0) Swift framework announced at WWDC
2025. Runs each container in its own micro-VM via AVF. Provides a dedicated IP per
container — no per-port forwarding required. Uses Virtualization.framework under the
hood.

**Networking model:** VM-per-container with dedicated IPs. The framework manages
networking internally; it exposes Netlink socket APIs for in-container network
configuration. Specific entitlements for networking are not publicly documented, but
AVF's `com.apple.security.virtualization` is required.

| Axis | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | Sub-second container starts claimed. Networking benchmarks not yet available. |
| **Reliability** | Unknown; framework is 0.x with no production track record. |
| **Long-term viability** | High if Apple continues investment; risky as 0.x dependency. |
| **Entitlements** | `com.apple.security.virtualization` at minimum; full entitlement surface not documented. |
| **Open source** | **Yes. Apache 2.0.** ✓ |
| **Implementation complexity** | Very high: Swift-only API, no C interface; Rust ↔ Swift FFI is painful. |
| **macOS requirement** | **macOS 26 only.** Blocks ~95% of existing macOS installs. |
| **Verdict** | 2027+ watch item. Track macOS 26 adoption and 1.0 release. |

## Recommendation for pelagos-mac

### Current implementation (v0.2.0): smoltcp userspace NAT relay

The implemented solution is `VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment` (option 5) paired
with a pure-Rust smoltcp NAT relay (PR #117). This replaced both `VZNATNetworkDeviceAttachment`
(option 1) and `socket_vmnet` (option 3), which were evaluated and discarded.

**Why smoltcp won:**

1. **Zero external dependencies.** No Homebrew packages, no launchd daemons, no
   privileged helpers, no installer steps. Works out of the box.
2. **No kernel NAT state to degrade.** smoltcp is pure userspace — there is no PF
   anchor, no vmnet handle, and no daemon that can lose its connection.
3. **Pure Rust.** Consistent with the no-Go, no-subsystem-dependency architecture.
4. **No entitlements.** `VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment` requires no special
   entitlement on the caller binary.
5. **Proven at scale.** 27/27 devcontainer e2e tests pass, including Dockerfile
   builds with `apt-get install` (large multi-file downloads over TCP).

**Architecture:**
```
VM virtio-net NIC
  → VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment (SOCK_DGRAM socketpair)
    → pelagos-vz nat_relay.rs (smoltcp TCP stack + raw UDP interception)
      → host TCP/UDP sockets → internet
```

**Known tradeoffs vs kernel NAT:**
- Throughput for bulk transfers (OCI image pulls) is sufficient but not as fast as
  vmnet kernel path. This has not been a practical problem.
- Each TCP connection requires a host socket and a relay thread. Connection scaling
  is bounded by host FD limits, not smoltcp itself.

### Future watch items

**vmnet.framework direct (option 2):** If pelagos reaches commercial distribution
and Apple entitlement approval is feasible, option 2 offers higher bulk throughput.
File with Apple Developer Relations when there is a clear distribution story.

**Apple Containerization (option 8):** Track for 2027 when macOS 26 has meaningful
market share and the framework has a security track record.

### Ruled out

- **Option 1 (VZNATNetworkDeviceAttachment):** PF anchor degrades; unrecoverable
  without reboot on macOS 26. Replaced.
- **Option 3 (socket_vmnet):** Requires a privileged launchd daemon as a Homebrew
  install step. Replaced by the zero-dependency smoltcp relay.
- **Option 4 (Bridged):** Wrong security model for developer container tooling.
- **Option 7 (Kexts):** Dead.
